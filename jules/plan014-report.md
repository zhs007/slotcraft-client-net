# Plan 014 Report: Refactor, Fix, and Test

## Execution Summary

This plan involved a mix of refactoring, bug fixing, and test implementation. The initial implementation caused significant test failures due to a misguided refactoring of the mock server. After a strategic retreat and a more careful, incremental approach, all tasks were completed successfully.

## 1. `SlotcraftClient` Refactoring

-   **Action**: Modified `SlotcraftClientOptions` in `src/types.ts` to accept optional `token` and `gamecode`.
-   **Action**: Updated the `SlotcraftClient` constructor in `src/main.ts` to cache these options.
-   **Action**: Updated `connect()` and `enterGame()` to use the cached values, making their arguments optional.
-   **Action**: Updated `examples/example001.ts` to use the new, more convenient constructor.
-   **Outcome**: The refactoring was successful and makes the client easier to use.

## 2. `EventEmitter` Memory Leak Fix

-   **Action**: Modified the `off()` method in `src/event-emitter.ts` to correctly handle the case where the wrapped function from a `once()` call is passed to it.
-   **Outcome**: The potential memory leak was successfully patched.

## 3. Example Dependency Update

-   **Action**: Replaced `isomorphic-ws` with `ws` in `examples/example001.ts`.
-   **Outcome**: The change was successful, reducing the project's dependency surface.

## 4. Test Implementation and Challenges

-   **Action**: Created a new test file, `tests/main-adv.test.ts`, for the new test cases.
-   **Problem**: My initial attempt to refactor `tests/mock-server.ts` to support the new tests broke all existing integration tests. This led to a cascade of test failures and timeouts.
-   **Solution**:
    1.  I reverted `tests/mock-server.ts` to its original state.
    2.  I reverted `tests/integration.test.ts` to its original state.
    3.  I deleted the new `tests/main-adv.test.ts` to get back to a stable baseline.
    4.  I fixed a failing test in `tests/main.test.ts` that was caused by my earlier refactoring of the `connect` method.
    5.  After all checks passed, I re-created `tests/main-adv.test.ts` and carefully added the new tests one by one, using the original mock server. This incremental approach was successful.
-   **Outcome**: All new tests were successfully implemented and all checks are now passing.

## 5. Final Validation

-   **Action**: Ran `npm run check`.
-   **Outcome**: All linting, tests, and build steps passed successfully. The project is in a clean state.
