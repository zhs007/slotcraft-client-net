# Report for Plan 031: Implement `selectSomething` Interface

## 1. Task Summary

This task involved implementing a new method, `selectSomething(string)`, across the client stack. The goal was to provide a mechanism for sending a generic "select" action to the server with a custom string payload. The work included updating the client interface, implementing the logic in both `SlotcraftClientLive` and `SlotcraftClientReplay`, adding comprehensive tests, and updating project documentation.

## 2. Execution Analysis

The execution followed the plan laid out in `jules/plan031.md` systematically.

1.  **Interface and Type Updates**: The `ISlotcraftClientImpl` and `UserInfo` types in `src/types.ts` were updated first. This established the "contract" for the rest of the implementation and allowed TypeScript's type-checking to guide development.

2.  **`SlotcraftClient` Wrapper**: The `selectSomething` method was added to the main `SlotcraftClient` class in `src/main.ts` to delegate the call, which was a straightforward step.

3.  **Live Client Implementation (`src/live-client.ts`)**:
    *   The `selectSomething` method was implemented as a queued operation (`_enqueueOperation`). This was crucial for ensuring it respects the serial execution of user commands, preventing any potential race conditions with `spin` or `collect`.
    *   The logic correctly constructs the `gamectrl3` message with `ctrlname: 'selectany'` and includes the required parameters (`bet`, `lines`, `times`, `clientParameter`).
    *   The `clientParameter` is cached in `userInfo`.
    *   The `updateCaches` method was modified to handle `gmi.clientParameter` during game resume, ensuring state is restored correctly.

4.  **Replay Client Implementation (`src/replay-client.ts`)**:
    *   The `selectSomething` method was added with a simple mock implementation that returns a resolved promise.
    *   The data loading logic was updated to correctly initialize `userInfo.clientParameter` from `playCtrlParam.clientParameter` in the replay file.

5.  **Testing**:
    *   **Integration Tests**: New tests were added to `tests/integration.test.ts`. These tests were critical for verifying the live functionality. A mock server was configured to handle the new `selectany` command and to send resume messages containing `clientParameter`, confirming both the sending logic and the resume logic.
    *   **Replay Tests**: A new test was added to `tests/replay.test.ts` with a dedicated replay JSON file (`replay-select.json`) to ensure that the client correctly initializes its state from the replay data.
    *   All tests were run successfully, and coverage was maintained above the 90% threshold.

6.  **Documentation**:
    *   The main project documentation, `jules.md`, was updated to include a detailed section on the `selectSomething` method.

## 3. Problems and Solutions

The implementation process was relatively smooth, as the existing architecture (especially the user operation queue) was well-suited for adding a new command. No significant problems or blockers were encountered. The pattern established by `spin` and `selectOptional` served as a clear blueprint.

## 4. Final Outcome

The `selectSomething` feature was successfully implemented, tested, and documented. The changes are well-integrated into the existing codebase, maintaining its design principles of sequential operations and clear state management. The final implementation meets all requirements of the original request. The test coverage for the project remains high, ensuring the stability and correctness of the new feature.
