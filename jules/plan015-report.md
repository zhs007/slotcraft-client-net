| Step                            | Status      | Details / Notes                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Create Plan and Report Files | ✅ Complete | Created `jules/plan015.md` and this report file.                                                                                                                                   |
| 2. Update Type Definitions      | ✅ Complete | Added `WAITTING_PLAYER` state, `Optional` interface, and new fields to `UserInfo`.                                                                                                 |
| 3. Modify `SlotcraftClient`     | ✅ Complete | Implemented caching of spin parameters, logic for the new state transition, and the `selectOptional` method.                                                                       |
| 4. Add Integration Test         | ✅ Complete | Added a new test suite to `tests/integration.test.ts` to cover the entire player choice flow.                                                                                      |
| 5. Run Checks and Verify        | ✅ Complete | Ran `npm run check`. Fixed an initial linting dependency issue and then a test failure by correcting the client's handling of concurrent requests. All checks passed successfully. |
| 6. Update Documentation         | ✅ Complete | Updated `jules.md` with a new development log entry and `agents.md` with notes on the new game flow.                                                                               |

## 2. Development Log

### Step 1: Create Plan and Report Files

- **Action**: Created `jules/plan015.md` to outline the implementation strategy.
- **Action**: Created `jules/plan015-report.md` to document the execution of the plan.
- **Result**: Successfully created both files.

### Step 2: Update Type Definitions (`src/types.ts`)

- **Action**: Added `WAITTING_PLAYER` to `ConnectionState` enum.
- **Action**: Defined a new `Optional` interface.
- **Action**: Added `optionals?: Optional[]` and `curSpinParams?: SpinParams` to the `UserInfo` interface.
- **Result**: All necessary types were successfully updated to support the new feature.

### Step 3: Modify `SlotcraftClient` (`src/main.ts`)

- **Action**: In the `spin` method, stored the `ctrlparam` object in `this.userInfo.curSpinParams`.
- **Action**: In the `updateCaches` method, added logic to detect `finished: false` in `gamemoduleinfo` and transition the state to `WAITTING_PLAYER`.
- **Action**: Implemented the new public method `selectOptional(index: number)`.
- **Action**: Added `WAITTING_PLAYER` to the list of allowed states for sending commands in the `send` method.
- **Result**: The client is now capable of handling the player choice flow.

### Step 4: Add Integration Test (`tests/integration.test.ts`)

- **Action**: Added a new `describe` block named "Player Choice Flow".
- **Action**: Wrote a test case that mocks the server sending a choice request, and verifies that the client enters `WAITTING_PLAYER`, that `selectOptional` sends the correct command, and that the relevant promises resolve or reject as expected.
- **Result**: The new feature is covered by an end-to-end integration test.

### Step 5: Run Checks and Verify (`npm run check`)

- **Action**: Ran `npm run check`.
- **Result**: The check initially failed. After debugging and fixing a client logic issue related to concurrent requests (see below) and a missing dependency, the command completed successfully, validating the changes.

### Step 6: Update Documentation (`jules.md`, `agents.md`)

- **Action**: Added a new entry under the "Development Log" in `jules.md` for this task (Plan 015).
- **Action**: Added a "Game Flow Notes" section to `agents.md` to explain the new `WAITTING_PLAYER` state and `selectOptional` method to future agents.
- **Result**: Project documentation is now up-to-date with the new feature.

## 3. Issues and Resolutions

- **Issue**: `npm run check` failed on the first attempt because of a missing ESLint dependency (`@eslint/js`).
- **Resolution**: Installed the missing dependency by running `npm install @eslint/js`. After realizing this should be a dev dependency, I corrected `package.json` and regenerated `package-lock.json`.

- **Issue**: The integration test failed with an "A request with cmdid 'gamectrl3' is already pending" error, followed by a timeout. This was because the initial `spin()` call created a pending request that was never resolved (as the server doesn't send a `cmdret` in this flow), which then blocked the `selectOptional()` from sending its own `gamectrl3` command.
- **Resolution**: I identified this as a flaw in the client's logic. I updated the `selectOptional` method to be responsible for cleaning up the now-superseded `spin` request. It now finds the pending promise from the original `spin`, rejects it with a descriptive error message, and removes it from the pending queue. This allows the new `gamectrl3` request to proceed and ensures the original caller of `spin` doesn't hang forever. The integration test was updated to assert this correct rejection/resolution behavior.
