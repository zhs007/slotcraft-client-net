# Report for Plan 013: Code Review Fixes

## Execution Flow

1.  **Analysis**: I started by analyzing the user's request, which was based on `codereview/report-002.md`. I identified the key issues to be addressed: concurrent request handling (P0), command restrictions during login (P1), a JSON parsing inefficiency (P2), and a lack of comments for the `collect` logic (P2).

2.  **Planning**: I created a detailed plan (`jules/plan013.md`) outlining the steps to address each issue, including verification and documentation.

3.  **Implementation**: I made the following changes to `src/main.ts`:
    - **`send()` method**:
      - Added a check at the beginning to reject any new request if a request with the same `cmdid` was already in `pendingRequests`. This resolves the P0 concurrent request issue.
      - Added a condition to ensure that only the `flblogin` command can be sent when the client state is `LOGGING_IN`, fixing the P1 issue.
    - **`handleMessage()` method**:
      - Refactored the logic to parse the incoming JSON message only once, improving performance and readability as per the P2 recommendation.
    - **`collect()` method**:
      - Added detailed comments to the `deriveSequence` helper function to clarify that the logic for determining the collection sequence is based on specific protocol requirements.

4.  **Verification**:
    - I ran `npm install` to ensure all dependencies were correctly installed.
    - I executed `npm run check`, which runs ESLint, Vitest (unit and integration tests), and the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). All checks passed, confirming that my changes were safe and correct.

## Problems and Solutions

- **Problem**: The original code was vulnerable to race conditions if an API call was made twice with the same `cmdid` before the first one resolved.
- **Solution**: I implemented a simple locking mechanism in the `send` method. By checking `this.pendingRequests.has(cmdid)`, the library now immediately rejects a duplicate concurrent request, making the client's behavior predictable and preventing promise mis-assignment.

- **Problem**: The client could send arbitrary commands during the `LOGGING_IN` state, potentially leading to an invalid state on the server or client side.
- **Solution**: I added a state-specific guard to the `send` method, ensuring that only `flblogin` is permissible during the login process, making the state machine more robust.

- **Problem**: The code performed an expensive `JSON.parse` operation multiple times on the same data.
- **Solution**: I refactored the code to store the result of the `JSON.parse` call in a variable and reuse it, which is a straightforward performance optimization.

The implementation went smoothly, and the existing test suite was comprehensive enough to give me confidence in the changes.
