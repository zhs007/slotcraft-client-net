# Plan 023 Report: Refactored Example to Use ConnectionState Enum

## 1. Task Summary

This task was undertaken in direct response to user feedback regarding code quality in the `examples/example001.ts` script. The user correctly pointed out that using string literals for states was not best practice. The goal was to refactor the script to use the official `ConnectionState` enum provided by the library, thereby improving type safety, readability, and maintainability.

## 2. Execution Analysis

The plan was executed successfully.

1.  **Enum Inspection**: I first examined `src/types.ts` to confirm the structure and members of the `ConnectionState` enum.

2.  **Code Refactoring**: I performed two edits on `examples/example001.ts`:
    *   First, I added `ConnectionState` to the list of imports from `../src/types`.
    *   Second, I replaced all instances of state strings (like `'IN_GAME'`, `'SPINEND'`, etc.) with their corresponding enum members (e.g., `ConnectionState.IN_GAME`, `ConnectionState.SPINEND`).

3.  **Validation**:
    *   I ran `npm run check` after the refactoring. The command completed successfully, indicating that the changes were syntactically correct and did not introduce any regressions. The project's tests, linting, and build process all passed.

## 3. Final Outcome

The `examples/example001.ts` script is now a better example of how to use the library correctly. By using the `ConnectionState` enum, it is more robust against typos and benefits from TypeScript's type-checking capabilities. This change improves the overall quality of the codebase and provides a better, safer template for developers. This successfully addresses the user's feedback and concludes this improvement task.
