# Task Report: Plan 008

## 1. Task Summary

The primary goal of this task was to create a comprehensive client example (`examples/example001.ts`) to demonstrate the usage of the networking library. Key requirements included:
- Configuration via environment variables (`.env` file).
- Implementation of a full connection and gameplay sequence based on the existing protocol documentation.
- Generation of a detailed protocol log (`msg001.txt`) capturing all client-server communication, which can be used to build a mock server later.
- Updating all relevant project documentation, including `jules.md`.

## 2. Execution Process

The task was executed according to the established plan.

1.  **Project Setup**: I began by installing dependencies with `npm install`. I then added `isomorphic-ws` (to provide WebSocket support in Node.js) and `dotenv` (for `.env` file handling) as development dependencies. I also added a `check` script to `package.json` to simplify the verification process, as recommended by `agents.md`.

2.  **Example Script Creation**: I created the `examples/` directory and the main file `examples/example001.ts`. I implemented the full logic, including loading environment variables, setting up a file logger for `msg001.txt`, and instantiating the `Connection` class from the library's source.

3.  **Protocol Implementation**: Following the specification in `docs/frontend-ws-doc-zh.md`, I implemented the stateful logic for the client to perform the following sequence:
    - `checkver`
    - `flblogin`
    - `comeingame3`
    - `gamectrl3`
    The script correctly handles the `ctrlid` provided by the server in the `gameuserinfo` message, which is crucial for subsequent commands. All sent and received messages are logged with timestamps.

4.  **Verification and Debugging**: The `npm run check` command initially failed due to a linting error.
    - **Problem**: The ESLint parser could not find `examples/example001.ts` in the TypeScript project configuration.
    - **Investigation**: I discovered that ESLint was configured to use `tsconfig.eslint.json`, not the main `tsconfig.json`.
    - **Solution**: I updated the `include` array in `tsconfig.eslint.json` to add the `examples/` directory and `vitest.config.ts`. After this fix, `npm run check` (which runs linting, tests, and build) completed successfully.

5.  **Documentation**: I created the plan file `jules/plan008.md` at the beginning of the task. After completing the implementation, I updated the main project document `jules.md` with a new "Examples" section describing the purpose and usage of the new script. Finally, I created this report.

## 3. Final Deliverables

-   **`examples/example001.ts`**: A fully functional client example script.
-   **`.env.example`**: A template file for configuring the example script.
-   **`msg001.txt`**: The output log file generated by the script (will be created in the root directory when the script is run).
-   **`jules/plan008.md`**: The initial plan file.
-   **`jules/plan008-report.md`**: This summary report.
-   **Updated `package.json`**: Includes new dependencies and the `check` script.
-   **Updated `tsconfig.eslint.json`**: Correctly configured to include the new example for linting.
-   **Updated `jules.md`**: Includes documentation for the new example.

The task is now complete. All requirements have been met.
