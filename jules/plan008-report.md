# Task Report: Plan 008 (and subsequent refactoring)

## 1. Task Summary

The initial goal was to create a client example (`examples/example001.ts`) using the library, with a key requirement to log all raw WebSocket traffic to `msg001.txt`.

This seemingly simple task evolved into a major refactoring of the core `SlotcraftClient` after user feedback revealed that the client's implementation was outdated and did not match the official protocol documentation.

## 2. Execution Process

### Part 1: Initial Implementation (using `Connection`)

1.  I first created the example script `examples/example001.ts` using the low-level `Connection` class.
2.  This approach was chosen because I discovered that the high-level `SlotcraftClient` implemented a protocol that was inconsistent with the one described in `docs/frontend-ws-doc-zh.md`.
3.  This initial version implemented the documented protocol (`flblogin`, `comeingame3`); `checkver` has since been deprecated and removed from the flow.

### Part 2: User Feedback and The Decision to Refactor

1.  Upon review, the user requested that the example be rewritten to use `SlotcraftClient`.
2.  I explained the protocol discrepancy and offered two paths: stick with the `Connection`-based example (which was correct according to the docs) or refactor `SlotcraftClient` itself.
3.  The user chose to **refactor `SlotcraftClient`**, which significantly expanded the scope of the task.

### Part 3: Refactoring `SlotcraftClient` and Test Suite

1.  **Core Logic Refactor**: I completely overhauled `src/main.ts`. The `SlotcraftClient` was rewritten to correctly implement the protocol from the documentation. This included changing the `connect` flow, creating a new `enterGame` method, and handling `cmdret` messages for promise-based request/response.
2.  **Logging Mechanism**: To fulfill the logging requirement without breaking abstraction, I added a `raw_message` event to the client, which emits all sent and received raw data.
3.  **Type Definitions**: I updated `src/types.ts`, simplifying the `ConnectionState` enum and `SlotcraftClientOptions`, and removing obsolete types.
4.  **Example Script Refactor**: With the new `SlotcraftClient` ready, I rewrote `examples/example001.ts` to use it. The new example is much cleaner and showcases the intended API.
5.  **Test Suite Overhaul (Major Challenge)**: The most difficult part of this task was fixing the test suite in `tests/main.test.ts`. The existing tests were incompatible with the new promise-based flows.
    - **Problem**: The tests were consistently failing with timeout errors due to a complex and problematic interaction between Vitest's fake timers (`vi.useFakeTimers()`) and the promise chains in the `SlotcraftClient`.
    - **Solution**: After multiple failed attempts to debug the fake timer interaction, I made the decision to remove fake timers entirely from the `main.test.ts` suite. I rewrote all tests, including those for timeouts and reconnections, to use real timers with short delays. This approach proved successful and stabilized the test suite.

## 3. Final Deliverables

- **Refactored `src/main.ts`**: A `SlotcraftClient` that is now compliant with the project's official protocol documentation.
- **Rewritten `tests/main.test.ts`**: A stable and correct test suite that properly validates the `SlotcraftClient` using real-time async operations.
- **Updated `src/types.ts`**: Cleaned up and modernized type definitions.
- **`examples/example001.ts`**: A clean, high-level example script demonstrating the correct usage of the library.
- **Updated `jules.md`**: The project's core documentation now accurately reflects the state and API of the `SlotcraftClient`.
- All other deliverables from the original plan (`.env.example`, `msg001.txt` generation, etc.) are also complete.

This task was far more complex than anticipated, but the result is a significantly improved, more consistent, and more reliable client library.
