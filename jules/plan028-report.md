# Report for Plan 028: Cache defaultScene from gamemoduleinfo

## 1. Task Execution Summary

The goal was to cache the `defaultScene` data from `gamemoduleinfo` messages, transform it into a 2D array, and make the transformation logic a reusable, tested, and documented utility function. The execution followed the plan precisely.

1.  **Utility Function**: Created `src/utils.ts` and implemented the `transformSceneData` function with JSDoc comments.
2.  **Unit Tests**: Created `tests/utils.test.ts` with comprehensive tests covering the happy path and various edge cases (null input, malformed data, empty arrays).
3.  **Type Definition**: Updated the `UserInfo` interface in `src/types.ts` to include the new `defaultScene?: number[][]` property.
4.  **Integration**: Modified the `updateCaches` method in `src/main.ts` to use the new `transformSceneData` function and populate `this.userInfo.defaultScene` when a `gamemoduleinfo` message with `defaultScene` is received.
5.  **Export**: Exported `transformSceneData` from the library's main entry point, `src/index.ts`.
6.  **Verification**: Ran `npm run check`, which passed successfully after fixing an environment issue.
7.  **Documentation**: Updated `jules.md` with a new "Utilities" section documenting the `transformSceneData` function.

## 2. Problems Encountered and Solutions

### Problem: ESLint Command Failure

- **Symptom**: The `npm run check` command failed at the `npm run lint` step with the error: `Error: Cannot find module '@eslint/js'`.
- **Diagnosis**: This error typically means a required npm package is not installed in the `node_modules` directory. I first checked `package.json` and confirmed that `@eslint/js` was indeed listed as a `devDependency`. This suggested that the `node_modules` directory was out of sync with the `package.json` file.
- **Solution**: I ran `npm install` to refresh the dependencies and install any missing packages. After the installation completed successfully, I re-ran `npm run check`, and all steps (lint, test, build) passed without any issues.

## 3. Final Code Review

The changes are clean and self-contained.
- The new utility function is pure, well-documented, and thoroughly tested.
- The integration into `main.ts` is minimal and safe, checking for the existence of `defaultScene` before processing.
- The types are updated correctly.
- The public API is extended by exporting the new utility.
- The project documentation is updated.

The solution successfully meets all requirements of the original task.
