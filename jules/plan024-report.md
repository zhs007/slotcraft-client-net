# Task Report: Plan 024 - Enhance Constructor with Additional Context

## 1. Task Summary

The primary goal of this task was to extend the `SlotcraftClient` constructor to accept four new optional parameters: `businessid`, `clienttype`, `jurisdiction`, and `language`. These parameters needed to be included in the `flblogin` request payload to provide additional context to the server during the authentication process. The task also involved updating documentation and ensuring all changes were covered by tests.

## 2. Execution Log

### a. Planning and Initial Exploration

- **Action**: Reviewed the user request and existing codebase, including `src/main.ts`, `src/types.ts`, `jules.md`, and `agents.md`.
- **Outcome**: A clear understanding of the required changes was established. A detailed, step-by-step plan was created and documented in `jules/plan024.md`.

### b. Type Definition Updates

- **Action**: Modified `src/types.ts`.
- **Details**:
  - Added `businessid?: string`, `clienttype?: string`, `jurisdiction?: string`, and `language?: string` to the `SlotcraftClientOptions` interface, including JSDoc comments explaining their purpose and default values.
  - Added the same four fields to the `UserInfo` interface to enable caching on the client instance.
- **Verification**: `read_file` was used to confirm that the changes were correctly applied.

### c. Core Logic Implementation

- **Action**: Modified `src/main.ts`.
- **Details**:
  - The `SlotcraftClient` constructor was updated to process the new options, applying the specified defaults (`''`, `'web'`, `'MT'`, `'en'`) if they were not provided. The values were then cached in the `this.userInfo` object.
  - The `_login` method was updated to include `businessid`, `clienttype`, `jurisdiction`, `language`, and `gamecode` in the `flblogin` command's payload.
- **Verification**: `read_file` confirmed the successful modification of the constructor and login method.

### d. Testing

- **Action**: Modified `tests/integration.test.ts`.
- **Details**:
  - Reviewed existing tests to ensure they would not break. Since the new parameters are optional, no breaking changes were identified.
  - Added a new test case (`should use custom parameters from constructor in login payload`) to specifically verify that custom values for the new parameters are correctly sent in the login request.
  - Modified an existing test (`should connect, login, and transition to LOGGED_IN state`) to also assert that the default values are sent when no custom values are provided.

### e. Validation and Troubleshooting

- **Action**: Ran `npm run check`.
- **Challenge**: The initial run failed during the `lint` step with the error `Error: Cannot find module '@eslint/js'`.
- **Resolution**:
  - Inspected `package.json` and found that `@eslint/js` was listed as a `devDependency`.
  - Deduced that the module was not installed in the environment's `node_modules` directory.
  - Ran `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
  - Re-ran `npm run check`, which then completed successfully, with all linting checks and tests passing.

### f. Documentation

- **Action**: Updated `jules.md`.
- **Details**: Appended a new entry to the "Development Log" detailing the work done under "Plan 024", including the goal, implementation details, and outcomes.

## 3. Challenges and Solutions

The only significant challenge was the initial failure of the `npm run check` command. The error message clearly pointed to a missing module. The solution was straightforward: running `npm install` to ensure the project's dependencies were fully installed in the local environment. This is a common issue in containerized or fresh environments and was resolved quickly.

## 4. Final Outcome

The task was completed successfully. The `SlotcraftClient` is now more flexible and provides richer context to the server on login. The changes are well-documented, thoroughly tested, and integrated cleanly into the existing codebase. All validation checks pass, confirming the quality and correctness of the implementation.
