# Plan 020 Report: Resume State Implementation

## 1. Execution Summary

The goal of this task was to implement a "resume" state for the client. This state handles scenarios where a user joins a game (`comeingame`) and discovers that a previous game round was not fully completed. The implementation was successful and followed the plan closely.

### Execution Steps:
1.  **Analysis**: I analyzed the request and the existing codebase (`src/main.ts`, `src/types.ts`). I identified that the logic should be placed in the `cmdret` handler for the `comeingame3` command, as this ensures the preceding `gamemoduleinfo` message has been processed.
2.  **State Addition**: I introduced a new `ConnectionState.RESUMING` to make the state flow more explicit and easier to debug. The `enterGame` method was updated to use this state.
3.  **Core Logic**: I implemented the core resume logic in the `comeingame3` `cmdret` handler. This logic mirrors the existing `gamectrl3` handler to determine if the client should transition to `SPINEND` (a win is pending collection), `WAITTING_PLAYER` (a player choice is pending), or `IN_GAME` (a normal state).
4.  **Auto-Collect**: The auto-collect feature, which was already present for normal spins, was also added to the resume flow to automatically acknowledge intermediate results.
5.  **Commenting**: I added extensive comments to the new `RESUMING` state, the `enterGame` method, and the `comeingame3` handler to clearly document the new functionality.
6.  **Testing**: I added a new test suite named "Resume Flow" to `tests/integration.test.ts`. This suite includes three tests covering the primary resume scenarios: resuming to `SPINEND`, resuming to `WAITTING_PLAYER`, and resuming with auto-collect triggered.
7.  **Verification**: I ran `npm run check`. Initially, this failed due to a problem with ESLint dependencies. I resolved this by running `npm install` and then re-running the check, which then passed successfully.

## 2. Problems Encountered & Solutions

- **Problem**: The `npm run check` command failed during the `lint` step with the error `Error: Cannot find module '@eslint/js'`.
- **Diagnosis**: I inspected `eslint.config.cjs` and `package.json`. The dependency `@eslint/js` was correctly listed in `devDependencies`, which suggested an incomplete or corrupted `node_modules` directory.
- **Solution**: I ran `npm install` to refresh the dependencies. After this, `npm run check` completed successfully.

## 3. Test Coverage

The final test coverage for `src/main.ts` is `87.85%`, and the total coverage is `89.42%`. This is a slight decrease from the previous `90.33%`. The new tests cover all branches of the added resume logic, but the overall percentage was slightly diluted. Given that the new feature is fully tested and the decrease is minimal, this was deemed acceptable for this task.
