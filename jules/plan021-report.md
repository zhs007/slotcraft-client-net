# Plan 021 Report: Enhanced Example Script to Handle Game Resume

## 1. Task Summary

The objective of this task was to update the `examples/example001.ts` script to correctly handle "game resume" states. Previously, the script assumed that after a successful `enterGame` call, the client would always be in the `IN_GAME` state. This was incorrect, as the server could resume the game into a `SPINEND` (pending win collection) or `WAITTING_PLAYER` (pending a choice) state.

The task involved refactoring the example script to make it more robust and to better demonstrate the capabilities of the `SlotcraftClient` library.

## 2. Execution Analysis

The execution followed the plan precisely.

1.  **Dependency Installation**: I began by running `npm install` to set up the environment. This completed without any issues.

2.  **Code Modification**: I refactored the logic in `examples/example001.ts`.
    - I introduced a central `gameLoop` async function.
    - This function is now called immediately after `client.enterGame()` resolves.
    - Inside the loop, it uses a `while(true)` construct to repeatedly check the client's state (`client.getState()`).
    - It explicitly handles the `SPINEND` state by calling `client.collect()` and the `WAITTING_PLAYER` state by calling `client.selectOptional()`.
    - Only when the state is confirmed to be `IN_GAME` does it proceed to the `spinAcrossLines` function, which contains the original logic for running a sequence of spins.
    - The `try...catch` blocks and exit conditions were updated to work with the new loop structure.

3.  **Validation**:
    - I ran `npm run check`, which executes linting, all tests, and a project build. The command passed successfully, confirming that my changes to the example did not cause any regressions in the core library.
    - I executed the script with `npx ts-node examples/example001.ts`. As I don't have a valid `.env` file, the script exited as expected with an error message about missing environment variables. This confirmed that the TypeScript code is valid and the script is executable.

## 3. Encountered Problems and Solutions

No significant problems were encountered during this task. The existing client architecture in `src/main.ts` was already well-equipped to handle the resume logic at its core; the only deficiency was in the example script that demonstrated its usage. The solution was a straightforward refactoring of the example script's control flow.

## 4. Final Outcome

The task was completed successfully. The `examples/example001.ts` script is now a much better illustration of how to build a robust game client. It correctly handles states that can occur upon resuming a game, making it a more useful reference for developers using the library.
