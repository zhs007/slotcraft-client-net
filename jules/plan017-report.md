# Plan 017 Report: Refactor Collect Logic and Implement Auto-Collect

## 1. Task Summary

This task involved a significant refactoring of the `collect` method and the introduction of an "auto-collect" mechanism to improve network efficiency and simplify the client-side logic. The original `collect` method was overly complex and contained logic that was difficult to maintain.

## 2. Implementation Details

### a. `collect()` Method Refactoring

- **Removed Complexity**: The `deriveSequence` helper function and the logic for sending multiple `collect` commands in a sequence were completely removed from the `collect` method.
- **Simplified `playIndex` Logic**: The method now follows a clear, simple rule for determining the `playIndex`:
  1.  Use the `playIndex` if it's explicitly provided.
  2.  If not provided, default to `lastResultsCount - 1` (the index of the final result).
  3.  As a fallback, use the cached `lastPlayIndex + 1` if `lastResultsCount` is unavailable. This was a final correction to a bug where the old `lastPlayIndex` was being re-used.
- **Improved Commenting**: Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to the `collect` method explaining its purpose, parameters, and the new logic.

### b. Auto-Collect Implementation

- **Trigger**: An auto-collect mechanism was added to the `cmdret` handler for the `gamectrl3` command (used by `spin` and `selectOptional`).
- **Logic**: After a `spin` or `selectOptional` completes, the client checks if the number of results (`lastResultsCount`) is greater than 1.
  - If it is, the client automatically calls `this.collect()` with a `playIndex` of `lastResultsCount - 2`.
- **Purpose**: This action confirms all but the final result with the server in the background, reducing the number of explicit `collect` calls the user-facing application needs to make.
- **Error Handling**: The auto-collect call is wrapped in a `.catch()` block that logs any errors but does not let them propagate. This ensures that a failure in this background optimization does not disrupt the primary game flow.
- **Commenting**: Added comments in the `handleMessage` method to explain the auto-collect feature.

## 3. Verification and Testing

- The initial changes caused several tests to fail, as they were written to validate the old, more complex `collect` behavior.
- The following tests were updated:
  - `tests/main.test.ts`: Updated an expected error message to match the more descriptive message in the new implementation.
  - `tests/main-adv.test.ts`: Replaced an obsolete test for sequential collection with a new test that specifically validates the auto-collect logic.
  - `tests/integration.test.ts`: Rewrote the entire `Collect Flow` test suite. The new tests verify the auto-collect behavior in one case and test the manual collect failure path in another by ensuring auto-collect does not trigger (`resultsCount: 1`).
- After fixing the tests, `npm run check` was executed, and all tests, linting, and build steps passed successfully.

## 4. Conclusion

The `collect` logic is now simpler, more aligned with the project's requirements, and easier to maintain. The new auto-collect feature will improve the efficiency of the network protocol by reducing round-trips for multi-stage wins. The code is well-commented and the test suite has been updated to reflect the new, correct behavior.
