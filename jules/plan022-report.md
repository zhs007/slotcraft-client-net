# Plan 022 Report: Simplified Example Script's Resume Logic

## 1. Task Summary

This task was a revision of the work done in Plan 021, based on direct user feedback. The user found the initial implementation, which used a `gameLoop` function, to be overly complex for an example script. The goal was to refactor `examples/example001.ts` to use a simpler, more linear, and clearly commented approach for handling game resume logic.

## 2. Execution Analysis

The execution followed the new plan (Plan 022) successfully.

1.  **Code Refactoring**: I modified `examples/example001.ts` according to the user's feedback.
    - The `gameLoop` function was completely removed.
    - I added an inline `while` loop immediately after the `client.enterGame()` call. This loop is responsible for handling any non-standard game states (`SPINEND`, `WAITTING_PLAYER`) before proceeding.
    - Clear comments were added to delineate the "Handle Resume Logic" block and the "Start Main Spin Logic" block, making the script's flow much easier to follow.
    - A clarifying comment was also added to the `spinAcrossLines` function.
    - The logic within `spinAcrossLines` was also simplified to handle post-spin states (`SPINEND`, `WAITTING_PLAYER`) in a small, self-contained loop, making it more robust without adding too much complexity.

2.  **Validation**:
    - `npm run check` was executed and passed without any errors, ensuring the refactoring did not introduce any regressions.
    - `npx ts-node examples/example001.ts` was run. As expected, it exited with an error about missing environment variables, confirming the script remains syntactically correct and executable.

## 3. Encountered Problems and Solutions

The main challenge was interpreting the user's feedback correctly to strike the right balance between robustness and simplicity suitable for an example. The chosen solution—a simple, inline `while` loop—directly addresses the feedback by making the control flow linear and explicit, avoiding the abstraction of a separate `gameLoop` function.

## 4. Final Outcome

The task was completed successfully. The `examples/example001.ts` script is now significantly clearer and serves as a better educational tool for developers. It demonstrates the necessary resume logic in a straightforward manner that is easy to understand and adapt. The code is cleaner, better-commented, and more aligned with the user's expectations for an example file.
