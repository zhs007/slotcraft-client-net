### Task Report for plan016

#### Objective

Modify the `example001.ts` script to:
1.  Handle the `WAITTING_PLAYER` state by randomly selecting an optional action.
2.  Change the spin logic to perform 100 spins per line configuration, regardless of win/loss outcomes.

#### Execution Summary

1.  **Analyzed the Request:** Understood the two primary requirements for changing the logic in `example001.ts`.
2.  **Code Exploration:**
    *   Reviewed `examples/example001.ts` to understand the existing spin logic and event handling.
    *   Inspected `src/types.ts` to confirm the definition of the `WAITTING_PLAYER` state and the `Optional` type.
    *   Examined `src/main.ts` to understand how the state machine transitions to `WAITTING_PLAYER` and how the `selectOptional` method is implemented.
3.  **Planning:** Created `jules/plan016.md` with a step-by-step plan to implement the changes.
4.  **Implementation:**
    *   **Handling `WAITTING_PLAYER`:**
        *   Modified the `onState` event handler in `example001.ts`.
        *   Added a condition to check if the `current` state is `WAITTING_PLAYER`.
        *   If true, the code now retrieves the available `optionals` from `client.getUserInfo()`.
        *   It then selects a random option and calls `client.selectOptional()` with the corresponding index.
    *   **Updating Spin Logic:**
        *   Modified the `spinAcrossLines` function in `example001.ts`.
        *   Removed the `seenWin`, `seenLose`, and `attempts` variables.
        *   Replaced the `while` loop with a `for` loop that iterates exactly 100 times for each line setting.

#### Encountered Issues and Resolutions

No significant issues were encountered during this task. The existing structure of the `SlotcraftClient` and the clarity of the codebase made the changes straightforward.

#### Final Outcome

The `example001.ts` script now correctly handles the `WAITTING_PLAYER` state by making a random selection and performs a fixed 100 spins for each line configuration as requested.
