## 3. Issues and Resolutions

- **Initial Issue (from user)**: The first implementation (Plan 015) had a critical logic flaw where it transitioned state based on a passive `gamemoduleinfo` message instead of waiting for the `cmdret`, violating the protocol and causing race conditions.
- **Resolution**: This entire plan is the resolution. The core of the fix will be to move all state transition logic into the `cmdret` handler, ensuring the client's state machine is robust and correctly synchronized with the server's command-response flow.
